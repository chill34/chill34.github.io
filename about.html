      <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Cody Hill. I currently attend Eastern Michigan University as a Computer Science </br>
        Major and Psychology Minor (with a focus on Social Psychology). I have only ever wanted one job </br>
        in my life, and that's to create video games. I prefer programming over the other aspects (animation, </br>
        lighting, etc.), but I also like storyboarding, chracter development, writing, etc.. If I was to pick </br>
        any specific game company to work for it would be Bethesda because I would love to be a part of an </br>
        open world epic fantasy such as Skyrim or Fallout.</br></br>

        Outside school and work, my hobbies include, but are not limited to, reading, watching anime and </br>
        television, and playing video games. I prefer PlayStation over Xbox but I do love both. </br>
        I have never gotten into PC Gaming, but have dabbled in it a bit and I do enjoy it. </br>
        My dream and hope for the future is to own a "full-dive" VR device such as the ones shown </br>
        in Sword Art Online. It would be amazing to actually "visit" other worlds using one. </br>
        I have a sizeable collection of books and a few  POP! Vinyl Figures that I've taken to collecting. </br>
